[Verse 1]
Mainit tulad ng bala,
Lumilipad nang mabilis, di ko naabutan,
Puso kong nakalibing sa kabaong,
Alam mo na noon pa man,
Ikaw ang bida, ang pangunahing atraksyon,
Mga kamera’y kumikislap para sa’yo.

[Pre-Chorus]
Like, ooh
You got everybody's eyes undressing you
And I see it too
Yeah, ooh
You could have anyone else you wanted to
I'm begging you

[Chorus]
Taas ang kamay, Gabriela, Gabriela
Taas ang kamay, Gabriela-la-la
Bumalik ka sa aking kamag-anak, Gabriela
Bumalik ka, Gabriela-la-la
Kasi, ooh
Maaari kang magkaroon ng iba pang gusto mo
Nakikiusap ako sayo (Hey)
Taas ang kamay, Gabriela, Gabriela
Taas ang kamay, Gabriela-la-la, la-la-la-la

[Verse 2]
Skin amaretto
I bet you taste just like the summer
Under the covers (Hey)
Me in the middle
Overprotective of my lover
You make me wonder

[Pre-Chorus]
Like, ooh
If you made all of these fantasies come true
What would you do?
Yeah, ooh
You could have anyone else you wanted to
But I'm begging you

[Chorus]
Huwag mong agawin, Gabriela, Gabriela
Huwag mong agawin, Gabriela-la-la
Siya’y sa akin lamang, Gabriela
Kaya lumayo ka na, Gabriela-la-la
'Cause, ooh
You could have anyone else you wanted to
I'm begging you (Hey)
Hands off, Gabriela, Gabriela
Hands off, Gabriela-la-la, la-la-la-la

[Post-Chorus]
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la (Oh, no)

[Bridge]
He came here with me, and so with me he’ll go.
His eyes belong here, I'll never let that go.
He loves only me, the rest don't matter,
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
He came here with me, and so with me he’ll go.
His eyes belong here, I'll never let that go.
He loves only me, the rest don't matter,
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[Chorus]
손 떼, 가브리엘라, 가브리엘라  
손 떼, 가브리엘라-라-라 (가브리엘라)  
내 남친 건드리지 마, 가브리엘라  
물러서, 가브리엘라-라-라 (오, 가브리엘라-라-라)
'Cause, ooh
You could have anyone else you wanted to
I'm begging you (I'm begging you; Hey)
Hands off, Gabriela (Gabriela, hands off), Gabriela
Hands off (Hands off), Gabriela-la-la, la-la-la-la (La-la-la-la)

[Outro]
La-la-la-la (La-la-la-la)
La-la-la-la (La-la-la-la)
La-la-la-la
(Back off, back off, back off)
